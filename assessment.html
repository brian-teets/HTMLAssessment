        "No," said Harry, without the faintest idea what Crouch was talking about.
        <strong><em>"Dumbledore's?"</em></strong> "That's right," said Harry. Crouch was pulling him closer; Harry tried to loosen Crouch's grip
        on his robes, but it was too powerful. "Warn ... Dumbledore ..." "I'll get Dumbledore if you let go of me," said Harry.
        "Just let go, Mr. Crouch, and I'll get him.. . ."
        "Thank you, Weatherby, and when you have done that, I would like a cup of tea.  My wife and son will be arriving shortly,
        we are attending a concert tonight with Mr. and Mrs. Fudge."

        <strong><em>"Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort,"</em></strong> said Dumbledore.  "He risked his own life to return Cedric's body to Hogwarts.
        He showed, in every respect, the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort, and for this, I honor him."
        Dumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his goblet once more.  Nearly everyone in the Great Hall followed suit.
        They murmured his name, as they had murmured Cedric's, and drank to him.  But through a gap in the standing figures.
        Harry saw that Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and many of the other Slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched.
        Dumbledore, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see them. When everyone had once again resumed their seats, Dumbledore continued,
        "The Triwizard Tournament's aim was to further and promote magical understanding.  In the light of what has happened - of
        Lord Voldemorts return - such ties are more important than ever before."
      </blockquote>

        Once before. Harry had found himself somewhere that nobody could see or hear him. That time, he had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary,
        right into somebody else's memory . . . and unless he was very much mistaken, something of the sort had happened again...
        Harry raised his right hand, hesitated, and then waved it energetically in from of Dumbledore's face.  Dumbledore did not blink,
        look around at Harry, or indeed move at all. And that, in Harry's opinion, settled the matter.  Dumbledore wouldn't ignore him like that.
        He was inside a memory, and this was not the present-day Dumbledore.  Yet it couldn't be that long ago . . . the Dumbledore sitting next
        to him now was silver-haired, just like the present-day Dumbledore.  But what was this place?  What were all these wizards waiting for?
